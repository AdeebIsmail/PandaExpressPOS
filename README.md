# CharmanderPOS: A Webapp POS for Panda Express

CharmanderPOS is an all-in-one solution for Panda Express's POS system. This project is written using the Vue.JS framework for the frontend, Express.JS for the backend API, and Node as the package manager. The final product includes views for a self-checkout, cashier, manager, and menu boards.

## Getting Started
1. Ensure you have the latest version of Node.JS installed. [Instructions Here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
2. Clone this repo or download the full .zip above
3. Build the project by running `npm install` in the `/client` and `/server` folders
4. Run the project by running `npm run dev` in the `/client` and `/server` folders. Both must be running in their own terminal window for the app to function properly.
